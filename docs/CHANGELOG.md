# CHANGELOG

As of November 2023, the `CHANGELOG` is a feature of our documentation we'll use to report and summarize changes to downloads from the ScPCA Portal.

You can find more information about how and when your download was prepared in the following places:

* The date your download was packaged (`Generated on: {date}`) is included at the top of the README in your download.
* The version of the [`AlexsLemonade/scpca-nf`](https://github.com/alexsLemonade/scpca-nf) pipeline used to process data in your download is included in the `workflow_version` column of the `single_cell_metadata.tsv` or `bulk_metadata.tsv` file in your download.
For more information about `AlexsLemonade/scpca-nf` versions, please see [the releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/scpca-nf/releases).
